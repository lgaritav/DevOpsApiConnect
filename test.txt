Delete a document

To delete a document, send a DELETE request with the document's most recent _rev in the query string, to https://$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/$DATABASE/$DOCUMENT_ID.

The response contains the ID and the new revision of the document, or an error message if the delete failed.

Example of using HTTP to delete a document



DELETE /$DATABASE/$DOCUMENT_ID?rev=$REV HTTP/1.1

Example of using the command line to delete a document



# make sure $JSON contains the correct `_rev` value!
curl "https://$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/$DATABASE/$DOCUMENT_ID?rev=$REV" -X DELETE
